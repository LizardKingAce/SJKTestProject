# SJKTestProject

Alright there seems to be a strange issue when downloading the project from GitHub and loading it on a different computer where one file from the Github for Unity package doesn't read right. It caused a problem taking the project one laptop to another. The Star png also is lost for whatever reason. Hopefully there aren't any further bugs. About halfway through the github pushes weren't saving the objects in the scene and hierarchy, which led to the creation of a backup scene as well to try and get the repository to hold onto scene changes. It seems to have worked now. 

General movement notes: WASD to move, Mouse to orient camera

The first time the game is run, Best Time shows up as Infinity until it has a time to store
